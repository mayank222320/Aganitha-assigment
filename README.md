## 🎨 Design Elements

- **Color System**: Professional blue (#2563eb), indigo (#4f46e5), emerald (#059669) with appropriate feedback states
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with readable fonts optimized for scanning book information
- **Animations**: Smooth hover effects, loading states, and modal transitions
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile-first design with tablet (768px) and desktop (1024px) breakpoints
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 📡 API Integration

The application uses the Open Library Search API:
- **Base URL**: `https://openlibrary.org`
- **Search Endpoint**: `/search.json`
- **Cover Images**: `https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/{cover_id}-{size}.jpg`

### Search Parameters:
- `title`: Search by book title
- `author`: Search by author name
- `isbn`: Search by ISBN number
- `subject`: Search by subject/topic

## 🎯 User Experience Features

1. **Smart Search**: Dynamic search form with filter options
2. **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, hover effects, and smooth transitions  
3. **Information Density**: Balanced display of essential book information
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Load more results without page refresh
5. **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with retry options

## 📱 Responsive Design

- **Mobile (< 768px)**: Single column layout with optimized touch targets
- **Tablet (768px - 1024px)**: 2-column grid with adjusted spacing
- **Desktop (> 1024px)**: 3-4 column grid with full feature set

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network failure scenarios
